This is a wonderful Linux distribution. For many years, I was searching for my ideal distro. For a long time, I used Arch Linux with the [i3wm](https://i3wm.org/) tiling window manager. Eventually, I realized that I needed a distro that was as simple and reliable as possible, while still allowing the same level of customization as Arch. That distro turned out to be Void Linux. I was very surprised by how simple the [runit](https://docs.voidlinux.org/config/services/index.html) init system is and how pleasant the xbps package manager is to use. As my window manager, I use [LeftWM](https://leftwm.org/).

My main work device is a Steam Deck with dual boot.

## Programming Languages That I Use
